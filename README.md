# SystemsProgrammingAssignment1
for Linux use only, I didnt have time to rewrite this to compile on windows.

This project was created for my system programming course in 2016, it asked for two programs to be made; a client and a server.
These two programs would communicate over sockets to perform basic terminal functions such as ls and grep.

Last time I checked it works, so if it doesnt its probably your fault.
